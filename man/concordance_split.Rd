\title{Calculate and Plot Taxa Concordance for Merged Phyloseq Data}
\usage{
concordance_split(
  phyloseq1,
  phyloseq2,
  levels = c("Phylum", "Class", "Order", "Family", "Genus")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{phyloseq1}{A phyloseq object containing 16S sequencing data.}

\item{phyloseq2}{A phyloseq object containing WGS sequencing data.}

\item{levels}{A character vector specifying the taxonomic levels at which to calculate concordance.
Default is \code{c("Phylum", "Class", "Order", "Family", "Genus")}.}
}
\value{
A list with two elements:
  \describe{
    \item{results_combined}{A data frame in long format containing the calculated concordance
      metrics (PAC and WPAC) for each taxonomic level.}
    \item{Concordance_plots}{A ggplot2 object showing the distributions of concordance values with
      histograms, density curves, and vertical lines for the mean and median.}
  }
}
\description{
This function merges two phyloseq objects (one from 16S data and one from WGS data) using
the \code{merge_phy} function, and then calculates taxa concordance metrics (PAC and WPAC)
for a set of specified taxonomic levels. The results are combined into a long-format data frame,
and a ggplot2 object is generated displaying histograms and density curves for each concordance
measure, with vertical lines indicating the mean and median.
}
\details{
The function first calls \code{merge_phy} (which must be defined elsewhere in your package)
to merge the two input phyloseq objects. Then, for each taxonomic level in \code{levels}, it computes
the concordance using the \code{Taxa_Concordance} function. The results are combined, pivoted to a long format,
and summarized by taxonomic level and concordance measure. Finally, a faceted ggplot is generated to visualize
the distributions of concordance metrics.
