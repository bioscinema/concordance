\title{Global_Test: Perform Global Statistical Testing on Simulated Microbiome Data}
\usage{
Global_Test(sim.dat, test_method = c("shannon", "invsimpson", "braycurtis"))
}
\arguments{
\item{sim.dat}{A list containing simulated data. It must include:
\describe{
  \item{otu.tab.sim}{A matrix or data frame of OTU counts (OTUs as rows, samples as columns).}
  \item{covariate}{A vector of group labels (e.g., "0" and "1") for each sample.}
}}

\item{test_method}{A character string indicating which test to perform.
Must be one of \code{"shannon"}, \code{"invsimpson"}, or \code{"braycurtis"}.
\describe{
  \item{\code{"shannon"}}{Calculates Shannon diversity for each sample and compares groups using a Wilcoxon test.}
  \item{\code{"invsimpson"}}{Calculates Inverse Simpson diversity for each sample and compares groups using a Wilcoxon test.}
  \item{\code{"braycurtis"}}{Calculates Bray–Curtis distances and performs PERMANOVA using \code{adonis2}.}
}}
}
\value{
A numeric p-value from the selected statistical test.
}
\description{
This function takes a simulated dataset (a list containing an OTU table and a covariate vector)
and performs one of three statistical tests to compare groups: a Wilcoxon test on Shannon diversity,
a Wilcoxon test on Inverse Simpson diversity, or a PERMANOVA test on Bray–Curtis distances.
}
\details{
The function first transposes the OTU table so that rows represent samples and then calculates
either diversity indices or a distance matrix. Depending on the \code{test_method} chosen, it then performs either:
a Wilcoxon test (for diversity indices) or a PERMANOVA test (for Bray–Curtis distances) to compare groups.
