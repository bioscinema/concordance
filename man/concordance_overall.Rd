\title{Calculate Overall Concordance Metrics and Plot Their Distributions}
\usage{
concordance_overall(physeq)
}
\arguments{
\item{physeq}{A merged phyloseq object for which overall concordance metrics are to be computed.
The object should contain sample data and an OTU table with subject names, where each subject is
represented by both WGS and 16S data.}
}
\value{
A list with two elements:
  \describe{
    \item{results}{A data frame in long format containing the overall concordance metrics (IPAC and IWPAC)
      for each subject, along with the mean and median concordance values for each metric.}
    \item{plot}{A ggplot2 object displaying histograms and density curves for the concordance metrics,
      with vertical dashed lines for the mean and median values.}
  }
}
\description{
This function computes overall concordance metrics (IPAC and IWPAC) for a merged phyloseq object
by calling \code{ALL_Concordance}. The resulting metrics are then pivoted to a long format, and group-level
summary statistics (mean and median) are computed for each concordance measure. Finally, a faceted ggplot2
histogram and density plot is generated to display the distribution of concordance values with vertical
lines indicating the mean and median.
}
\details{
The function first calls \code{ALL_Concordance} to compute the overall inverse concordance metrics
for each subject from the merged phyloseq object. The output is then reshaped to long format using
\code{tidyr::pivot_longer}, so that the two metrics (IPAC and IWPAC) are contained in a single column.
For each concordance measure, the mean and median are computed and added to the data frame. Finally, a
ggplot2 object is created with a histogram (binwidth = 0.02) and density curve, and vertical dashed lines
are added to indicate the computed mean and median. The plot is faceted by the concordance measure.
